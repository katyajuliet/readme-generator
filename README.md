  ## Description:
  This project is a simple README Generator that allows users to enter a series of questions and the app automatically formats and generates a thorough README.md file with linked Table of Contents. Here is a video of the application demonstration: [video](./develop/Module%209%20Challenge-Katya%20Juliet_%20May%2020%2C%202022%206_14%20PM.mp4)


  ## Installation:
  Start by downloading the content files to your computer. Make sure to install NPM and node modules for this to run properly. Do not fork or clone repo as you will need to generate your own installs and link to your own repo for this app to function properly. Run npm 'init' and 'npm install inquirer' 

  ## Usage:
  After you download and install dependencies, enter "node index.js" into your terminal command line and begin to answer the questions followed by the enter key. Once complete, a new README file will be generated!
